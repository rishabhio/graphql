Things about graph ql 

## What is graphql ?? 
GraphQL is an open source data query and manipulation
language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries
with existing data. 

- Invented by Facebook ( Open Source )
- Use of type system to describe data 
- Exposes a single endpoint 
- Easier to aggregate data from multiple sources 

## How it works ?? 
- We define schemas 
- It's the job of resolvers to get the data 

## Resolvers 
- Resolver Functions 
- Payload of a graphql request consists of query fields 
- Graphql server has one resolver function per field
